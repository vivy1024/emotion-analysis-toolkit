Dear Xiaochuan Xue,

Thanks for your interest in the SAMM dataset.

You will need to download the licence agreement that can be found on this page: https://helward.mmu.ac.uk/STAFF/m.yap/dataset.php

Please then ensure you do the following:
If you are a normal researcher, you will need to get your group leader/full professor to sign and request on your behalf
They above will need to send to be from their institutional email, not from a personal account (such as qq.com)
They will also need to provide the public link to their institutional profile to confirm their position

Doing this will get you access to both SAMM and SAMM-LV. Failure to do the above points will result in further delays.

Regards,
Dr Adrian Davison | Senior Lecturer | Department of Computing and Mathematics | Manchester Metropolitan University

Dear Dr. Davison,

I am writing to request access to the SAMM (Spontaneous Actions and Micro-Movements) database for academic research purposes.

Researcher Information:
- Name: Xiaochuan Xue (薛小川)
- Affiliation: Xi'an Technological University (西安工业大学)
- Department: School of Mechatronics Engineering, Intelligent Manufacturing Engineering
- Email: 1765563156@qq.com

Research Purpose:
I am conducting research on micro-expression recognition and hidden emotion detection. I have developed a real-time detection system using a two-stage CNN-LSTM architecture, previously evaluated on the CASME II dataset (achieving 71.8% accuracy with 5-fold cross-validation).

I am now seeking to:
1. Conduct cross-dataset evaluation to assess model generalization (train on CASME II, test on SAMM)
2. Leverage SAMM's ethnic diversity (13 ethnicities) to validate model robustness across different populations
3. Implement Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) evaluation protocol for rigorous benchmarking
4. Compare multiple architectures including attention-based models and Transformer variants

I confirm that the database will be used solely for non-commercial academic research and will not be redistributed. I am happy to sign any required End User License Agreement (EULA).

Please let me know if additional information or documentation is required.

Best regards,
Xiaochuan Xue (薛小川)
