Subject: Request for Access to SMIC Database for Academic Research
 
Dear Prof. Zhao,

I am writing to request access to the SMIC (Spontaneous Micro-expression Corpus) database for academic research purposes.

Researcher Information:
- Name: Xiaochuan Xue (薛小川)
- Affiliation: Xi'an Technological University (西安工业大学)
- Department: School of Mechatronics Engineering, Intelligent Manufacturing Engineering
- Email: 1765563156@qq.com

Research Purpose:
I am conducting research on micro-expression recognition and hidden emotion detection. I have developed a real-time system using a two-stage CNN-LSTM architecture, previously evaluated on the CASME II dataset (achieving 71.8% accuracy with 5-fold cross-validation).

I am now seeking to:
1. Conduct cross-dataset evaluation to assess model generalization (train on CASME II, test on SMIC)
2. Implement Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) evaluation protocol
3. Compare multiple architectures including attention-based models and Transformer variants

I confirm that the database will be used solely for non-commercial academic research and will not be redistributed.

Please let me know if additional information or documentation is required.

Best regards,
Xiaochuan Xue
Xi'an Technological University
